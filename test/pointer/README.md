[NULL (legacy)](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/NULL)
and modern "nullptr" in
[C++11](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/nullptr)
[C23](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/nullptr)
are represented in Fortran

See [nullptr](../nullptr) for examples of checking for C / C++ NULL / nullptr from Fortran.
